        I am a visually impaired programmer. I have been programming for 3-4 years now and I love it. I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EmbeddedJS, ReactJS, NodeJS, and ExpressJS. I love to code. I use Atom right now although it is definately not optimized for screen readers or people with visually impairments.
